# Story

We’re excited to share that we’ve raised a $2 million seed round, led by **1984**, with participation from **Pioneer Fund**, **Y Combinator**, and a group of incredible angel investors.

Our mission is simple: **we want to** **build the first fully agentic inbox.** 

Email has been around for more than 30 years, but it hasn’t evolved much. People still spend hours every day stuck in clunky inboxes, constantly overwhelmed, and frustrated by how bad the experience feels. We think email deserves better. That’s what drives us, and we’re not stopping until we fix it.

We’re not there yet, but we’re well on our way.

Thank you to everyone who has supported us so far. Our investors, angels, early users, and friends have played a huge role in getting us to this point. We’re deeply grateful.

Finally, if you're excited about what we’re building and want to be apart of the future of email, we’re hiring and we’d love to hear from you!
